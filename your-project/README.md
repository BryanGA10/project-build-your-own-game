## Project Description

This quiz game will challenge your knowledge of the Star Wars universe through 5 multiple choice questions and three difficulty levels (Padawan, Jedi Master, and Force Ghost). You can try through all the levels or play a couple of times at the same level with random questions.

I chose this game first because I'm a big fan of Star Wars Universe and second because a quiz game is a fast and funny way to challenge a friend about their knowledge.

## Workflow

1.- I was using a Flowchart as a first step to plan the script.

2.- The second part was about trying to write a Pseudocode that allows me to get an idea of the variables and operations to do.

3.- Once I got a clear idea about the general path, I wrote the script in a straight way (without any function) and ran it several times to check if all works as planned. 

4.- The final part was to split the code, create the corresponding functions and link them to work as a unique script.

5.- I almost forgot to say that once the program works as I wanted, I jumped apart from the desk and felt very happy!
